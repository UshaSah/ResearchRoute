# ResearchRoute

## Overview

University Research Connector is an innovative application designed to help university students secure research positions by leveraging advanced OCR technology and intelligent resume parsing. This platform simplifies the search and application process for students aiming to collaborate with professors on research projects.

## Features

### OCR Scanning

- **Professor Name Extraction**: Our OCR technology allows students to scan a name template (e.g., a conference badge, office door nameplate, or publication) to instantly retrieve detailed information about a professor. Once a name is scanned, the app directs the user to a page showcasing the professor's research interests, publications, and open project positions.

### Resume Parser

- **Intelligent Data Extraction**: Students can upload their resumes, and our parser will meticulously extract and structure key components, such as:
  - **Name**: Your full name is extracted for personalized application processes.
  - **Experience**: All relevant work and research experience outlined for showcasing to potential research advisors.
  - **Education**: Academic history is summarized to highlight your academic journey.
  - **Skills**: Specialized and technical skills are identified, aligning your strengths with research needs.
  - **Coursework**: Relevant courses are displayed to emphasize subject matter proficiency.

### Applied Jobs

- **Application Tracking**: A dedicated section allows students to view all previously applied-for projects, tracking application statuses and managing follow-ups effectively.
